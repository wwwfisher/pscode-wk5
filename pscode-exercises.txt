// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

ask for input 1
ask for input 2
add input 1 to input 2 and store as answer
print answer

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for input 1
divide input 1 by 2
if remainder is 0
then even
else odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Prompt the user to enter 5 numbers, and store them in variables num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5.

Calculate the average of the five numbers.
Add up the 5 numbers and divide by 5. Store the result in a variable called average.

Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
Initialize two variables, minimum and maximum, to the value of num1.
Iterate through the remaining numbers, comparing each one to minimum and maximum. If a number is less than minimum, update minimum to that number. If a number is greater than maximum, update maximum to that number.

Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.
Print the following message to the user:

The average of the 5 numbers is: average
The smallest number is: minimum
The largest number is: maximum
